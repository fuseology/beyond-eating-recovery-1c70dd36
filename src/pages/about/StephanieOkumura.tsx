            <p>
              I was born and raised in California, lived in Hawai'i and Chicago, and now call Portland home. Each place has shaped my understanding of food culture and how geography, community, and heritage influence our eating.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Growing up with Japanese heritage, I've experienced firsthand the intersection of cultural food traditions with American food culture. This has given me deep appreciation for how food connects us to family, heritage, and identity—and why nutrition counseling must honor these connections.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In my free time, I love doing anything creative. I paint, work with pottery, crochet, create jewelry through silversmithing, and dance. Creativity is a form of self-expression and joy for me—much like food can and should be. I believe in finding pleasure in life's sensory experiences, whether that's the feel of clay in your hands, the taste of a beloved family recipe, or the movement of dance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I also have a dog named Kosho (こしょう - which means 'pepper' in Japanese). We love going on hikes together in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Spending time in nature grounds me and reminds me of the importance of slowing down, being present, and appreciating simple pleasures—all principles I bring into my nutrition practice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My diverse creative interests and love of different cultures inform how I practice dietetics. Just as there's no one 'right' way to create art, there's no one 'right' way to eat. My job is to support you in finding the approach that fits your unique life, culture, values, and body.
