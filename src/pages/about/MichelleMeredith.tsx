                <p>
                  Eating disorder treatment involves complex diagnostic codes (ICD-10) and procedure codes (CPT). Incorrect coding can result in claim denials or reduced reimbursement. My expertise ensures your treatment is coded accurately for maximum insurance coverage.

                <p>
                  Medical coding must comply with federal regulations, insurance policies, and industry standards. Non-compliance can result in audits, denials, or even fraud allegations. My commitment to compliance protects both you and our practice.

                  When coding is done right the first time, claims are approved faster, you receive clearer billing statements, and there are fewer billing surprises. My decade of experience means smoother processes and fewer headaches for you.
