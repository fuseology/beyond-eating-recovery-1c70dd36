              Gina's own recovery journey informs her belief that every person is already whole, and that problems in our lives result from a disconnection to this wholeness. She offers a compassionate, nonjudgmental space grounded in somatic awareness, mindfulness, Body Trust®, and Health at Every Size® principles. Gina has worked with athletes for 15 years and specializes in athlete eating disorders. Therapy is a space to support your process of embodiment, healing, and deeper connection to yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              From her perspective, our relationships with food and body are often meaningful coping strategies that reflect deeper emotional, relational, and lived experiences. In her work, she strives to offer a compassionate, nonjudgmental space where you can gently explore these layers with curiosity and care.
