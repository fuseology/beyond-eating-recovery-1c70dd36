                  I know firsthand what it's like to struggle with food and body issues.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  For years, I battled my own demons—comparing myself to every woman I saw, using food to hide my feelings, avoiding intimacy, and believing I couldn't be loved if I was fat. I resisted exercise as an act of rebellion against what others told me I should do and how I should look. Food became my primary coping mechanism, and hating my body became my constant companion.
                </p>
                
                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">
                  But all that has changed.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Now, I no longer use food to cope. I feel good about myself, my body, and my life. This personal transformation ignited my passion for helping others recover. I love that my work as a counselor involves helping you eat whatever you want and feel genuinely good about it.

                  My approach goes beyond traditional talk therapy. I help you develop healthier coping skills around food, your body, and your life in general. We'll address the root causes of your problems with food—because food issues and poor body image are symptoms of deeper needs that haven't been met.

                  Through step-by-step changes in counseling, you'll overcome your problems around food and develop a richer, more satisfying life. In the end, you won't just change your relationship with food—you'll transform your entire relationship with yourself.

                    For too long, you've divided food into 'good' and 'bad,' which translates into judging yourself as 'good me' or 'bad me' based on what you eat. This binary thinking fuels the restrict-binge cycle and keeps you trapped in shame.

You'll experiment with various activities to discover what brings you joy, energy, and embodiment. We'll address any exercise compulsion or avoidance, understanding the emotional roots of both extremes.

Movement becomes something you get to do, not something you have to do. You'll exercise for pleasure, stress relief, and health—not to earn food or punish your body.
