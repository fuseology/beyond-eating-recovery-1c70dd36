                  <p>An eating disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by persistent disturbances in eating behaviors, thoughts, and emotions. Eating disorders involve a preoccupation with food, body weight, and shape that significantly impacts physical health, emotional well-being, and daily functioning.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Common characteristics include:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                      <li>Intense fear of weight gain or being 'fat'</li>
                      <li>Distorted body image</li>
                      <li>Using food (restricting, binging, purging) to cope with emotions</li>
                      <li>Obsessive thoughts about food, calories, weight, or body shape</li>
                      <li>Rituals around eating or exercise</li>
                      <li>Social isolation related to eating or body concerns</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Eating disorders are NOT a choice or phase, about vanity, just about food or weight, or something you can just 'get over' with willpower.</p>

                  <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">They ARE complex mental health conditions often rooted in trauma, genetics, and environmental factors. They are treatable with proper support and are serious conditions that require professional help.</p>

                  <p className="italic">If you're questioning whether your relationship with food and your body is healthy, that question itself is often a sign that it's worth exploring further with a professional.</p>

                  <p>Many people struggle with the question of whether their eating or body image concerns 'count' as an eating disorder. You don't need a formal diagnosis to benefit from help.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Consider seeking support if you find yourself at the fridge over and over again, think about food much more than you want to, eat in secret, feel out of control around certain foods, have rigid food rules, obsess over your weight or appearance, compare your body to others constantly, are tired of dieting just to find yourself binging again, or use food to cope with difficult emotions.</p>
                  </div>

                  <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">The bottom line: If your relationship with food or your body is causing you distress, interfering with your life, or occupying significant mental space—you deserve support. You don't have to wait until things get 'bad enough.' Early intervention leads to better outcomes.</p>

                      <li><strong>Bulimia Nervosa:</strong> Cycles of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors. Self-evaluation heavily influenced by body shape and weight. Can occur at any body size</li>
                      <li><strong>Binge Eating Disorder (BED):</strong> Recurrent episodes of eating large amounts of food with feeling out of control. NO regular compensatory behaviors. Most common eating disorder in the US</li>

                      <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Men account for approximately 25% of people with anorexia and bulimia. Men are nearly as likely as women to have binge eating disorder. Transgender and non-binary individuals have higher rates of eating disorders</li>
                      <li><strong>Age:</strong> While onset is often in adolescence or young adulthood, many people develop eating disorders in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond</li>
                      <li><strong>Race & Ethnicity:</strong> Eating disorders occur across all racial and ethnic groups at similar rates. BIPOC individuals are less likely to be diagnosed due to systemic bias</li>
                      <li><strong>Body Size:</strong> People in larger bodies can and do have all types of eating disorders. Weight is NOT a reliable indicator of eating disorder severity</li>

                  <p className="italic">The 'wellness' trap: In diet culture, many disordered behaviors are disguised as 'wellness,' 'clean eating,' or 'fitness goals.' If your 'health goals' are making you unwell—they're not actually healthy.</p>

                  <p>Intuitive Eating is an evidence-based, non-diet approach to eating that helps you rebuild trust with your body's hunger, fullness, and satisfaction signals.</p>

                  <p>Developed by dietitians Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, Intuitive Eating consists of 10 principles that guide you back to your body's innate wisdom about eating.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intuitive Eating:</strong> Internal guidance from your body, honors hunger and fullness, flexible and individualized, designed for well-being, builds self-trust, sustainable for life</p>

                      <li><strong>Structured flexibility:</strong> For those very disconnected from hunger/fullness, temporary general structure as a bridge</li>
