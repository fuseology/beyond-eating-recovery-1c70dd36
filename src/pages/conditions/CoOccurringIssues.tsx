                Eating disorders rarely exist in isolation. Most individuals struggling with an eating disorder also experience other mental health conditions—what we call co-occurring issues or dual diagnosis. At Beyond Eating Recovery, we understand that lasting recovery requires treating all aspects of your mental health, not just eating disorder symptoms. Our integrated approach addresses depression, anxiety, trauma, substance use, and other conditions that intersect with your eating disorder. You deserve comprehensive care that sees you as a whole person.

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Co-occurring issues (also called dual diagnosis or comorbidity) refers to the presence of two or more mental health conditions occurring simultaneously. When someone has an eating disorder plus another psychiatric condition—such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, or substance use disorder—both conditions influence and interact with each other.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Why Co-Occurring Issues Are Common</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Eating disorders are fundamentally about coping with emotional pain, trauma, and difficult life circumstances. The behaviors—restricting, binge eating, purging, excessive exercise—serve as attempts to manage overwhelming feelings, numb pain, or gain a sense of control. Because the underlying issues driving the eating disorder are complex, it's not surprising that other mental health conditions are often present.
