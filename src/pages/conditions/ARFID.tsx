              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating disorder characterized by extremely limited food intake or variety due to sensory sensitivities, fear of aversive consequences (like choking or vomiting), or lack of interest in eating. Unlike other eating disorders, ARFID is not driven by body image concerns or desire for weight loss. At Beyond Eating Recovery, we provide specialized, compassionate treatment for ARFID that helps you expand your food repertoire, address underlying anxieties, and develop a healthier relationship with eating—without judgment about your food preferences or sensory experiences.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating or feeding disorder in which individuals eat only within an extremely limited range of foods, leading to nutritional deficiencies, dependence on supplements, impaired growth (in children), or significant interference with daily functioning. ARFID was officially recognized as a distinct diagnosis in the DSM-5 in 2013, replacing the previous diagnosis of "Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood."
