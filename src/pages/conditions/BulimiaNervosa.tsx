                  Bulimia nervosa is a complex mental health condition involving recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors intended to prevent weight gain. People with bulimia often feel trapped in a painful cycle of binging and purging, accompanied by intense shame, secrecy, and feelings of being out of control.

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Bulimia nervosa can cause serious, potentially life-threatening physical health complications—particularly from frequent purging. The effects of repeated vomiting, laxative abuse, and diuretic use can damage nearly every system in the body. However, with appropriate treatment and cessation of behaviors, many effects can be reversed or improved.
