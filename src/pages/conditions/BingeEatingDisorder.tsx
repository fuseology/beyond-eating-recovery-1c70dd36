                  Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food, often rapidly and to the point of discomfort, while experiencing a sense of loss of control. Unlike bulimia nervosa, BED does not involve regular compensatory behaviors such as purging, excessive exercise, or fasting.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                    Binge Eating Disorder was only officially recognized as a distinct eating disorder diagnosis in the DSM-5 in 2013, but the experience of binge eating has existed for generations. BED is the most common eating disorder, affecting people of all genders, ages, races, and body sizes. Despite common misconceptions, BED is not about food, weight, or willpower—it's about emotional regulation, trauma, restriction, and using food as a coping mechanism for difficult feelings.

                  <li>• <strong className="text-foreground">BED vs. Overeating:</strong> BED involves loss of control and significant emotional distress, not just eating past fullness</li>

                    You may have been told to "just eat less" or "have more willpower," but binge eating is not about discipline. It's a legitimate mental health condition that deserves proper treatment and compassion.

                  We believe that binge eating is not about food or lack of willpower. It's a coping mechanism for dealing with difficult emotions, trauma, restriction, and living in a culture that perpetuates shame about food and bodies. True healing addresses these underlying factors.
