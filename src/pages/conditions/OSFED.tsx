                Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) is a serious eating disorder diagnosis given when symptoms don't fully meet the criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or ARFID—but still cause significant distress and impairment. OSFED is not a 'less severe' eating disorder; research shows it's just as serious and life-threatening as other eating disorders. At Beyond Eating Recovery, we provide comprehensive treatment for all presentations of OSFED, recognizing that your struggle is real, valid, and deserving of specialized care—regardless of whether you fit neatly into diagnostic boxes.

                  Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) is a diagnostic category in the DSM-5 that encompasses eating disorders that cause clinically significant distress and impairment but don't meet the full diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or ARFID.

                    <p>
                      Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (AAN) involves all the symptoms of anorexia nervosa—restrictive eating, intense fear of weight gain, body image disturbance—but the individual's weight remains within or above what's considered "normal" range, despite significant weight loss.

                    <p>
                      Atypical anorexia is often underdiagnosed and undertreated because healthcare providers dismiss symptoms in larger bodies, individuals receive compliments on weight loss instead of concern, and insurance may deny treatment based on weight alone.
