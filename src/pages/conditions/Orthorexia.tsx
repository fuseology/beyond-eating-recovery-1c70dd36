              <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
                Orthorexia is an eating disorder characterized by an obsession with "healthy," "clean," or "pure" eating that becomes so restrictive and rigid it damages physical health, mental wellbeing, and quality of life. While orthorexia may begin with good intentions to improve health, it evolves into an all-consuming fixation that paradoxically creates harm. At Beyond Eating Recovery, we understand that orthorexia is eating disorder behavior disguised as wellness, and we provide compassionate treatment that helps you find true balance—not rigid perfection—in your relationship with food.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Orthorexia, or orthorexia nervosa, is an eating disorder characterized by an unhealthy obsession with eating foods perceived as "healthy," "pure," "clean," or "right." Unlike other eating disorders that focus primarily on quantity or body weight, orthorexia focuses on the quality and purity of food consumed.

                    <li><strong>Fixation on food quality:</strong> Obsessive concern with the "healthiness," purity, or source of food</li>
                    <li><strong>Rigid dietary rules:</strong> Extreme rules about what foods are "acceptable" to eat</li>
                    <li><strong>Progressive restriction:</strong> Increasingly narrow list of "safe" or "clean" foods</li>

                    <li><strong>Life interference:</strong> Social isolation, relationship problems, and impaired functioning</li>
                    <li><strong>Paradoxical health decline:</strong> Despite focus on "health," physical and mental health deteriorate</li>

                      Orthorexia is not about health—it's about control, anxiety, and perfectionism disguised as wellness. True health includes mental wellbeing, social connection, and life balance—not rigid adherence to food rules that create suffering.
