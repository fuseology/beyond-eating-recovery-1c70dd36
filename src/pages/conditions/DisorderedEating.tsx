                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Disordered eating refers to a wide range of irregular eating behaviors and attitudes toward food, weight, and body image that may not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a clinical eating disorder, but still cause significant distress and impact quality of life.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">The Spectrum Concept</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">Think of eating behaviors as existing on a continuum:</p>
                  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li><strong>One end:</strong> Intuitive, flexible eating with food freedom</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Disordered eating patterns (chronic dieting, food rules, body preoccupation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Other end:</strong> Clinical eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Important Distinctions</h3>
                  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>Disordered eating is extremely common in our diet-obsessed culture</li>
                    <li>Many people with disordered eating never develop a full eating disorder, but their suffering is still real</li>
                    <li>Disordered eating can be just as distressing and life-limiting as diagnosed disorders</li>
                    <li>You don't need to meet diagnostic criteria to deserve help</li>
                  </ul>

                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Why It Matters</h4>
                    <p className="mb-3">Disordered eating often goes unaddressed because people think "it's not bad enough" or "everyone does this." But these patterns:</p>
                    <ul className="space-y-2">
                      <li>• Cause significant psychological distress</li>
                      <li>• Impact relationships and social life</li>
                      <li>• Reduce quality of life and joy</li>
                      <li>• Can escalate into clinical eating disorders</li>
                      <li>• Deserve professional support and treatment</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Cultural Normalization</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">In diet culture, disordered eating is often praised and encouraged:</p>
                  <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>"Clean eating" obsessions are celebrated</li>
                    <li>Chronic dieting is normalized</li>
                    <li>Food restriction is seen as "discipline"</li>
                    <li>Body dissatisfaction is considered universal</li>
                    <li>Exercise punishment is called "wellness"</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Diet Culture</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">The single biggest contributor to disordered eating is living in a culture that:</p>

                      Many people fear recovery means unlimited weight gain. Reality: When you stop restricting and allow your body to find its natural set point, weight typically stabilizes. Bodies have genetic blueprints—restriction fights biology, while Intuitive Eating honors it.
